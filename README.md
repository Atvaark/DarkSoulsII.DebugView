## About
A framework for read only access to the game state of Dark Souls II 1.0.10 (non SotFS). Allows reading values of over 400 more or less reverse engineered C++ classes such as the manager classes for bullets, characters, cameras, items, maps and savegames.

The example application in this repository prints the name, health, stamina and position of all characters in the current game area to the console.
